matplotlib license
------------------

License:

Matplotlib only uses BSD compatible code, and its license is based on the PSF 
license. See the Open Source Initiative licenses page for details on individual 
licenses. Non-BSD compatible licenses (e.g., LGPL) are acceptable in matplotlib 
toolkits. For a discussion of the motivations behind the licencing choice, see Licenses.

Copyright Policy:

John Hunter began matplotlib around 2003. Since shortly before his passing in 2012, 
Michael Droettboom has been the lead maintainer of matplotlib, but, as has always 
been the case, matplotlib is the work of many.
Prior to July of 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, the copyright of the source code was 
held by John Hunter. As of July 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, matplotlib has moved 
to a shared copyright model.
matplotlib uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over 
their contributions to matplotlib. But, it is important to note that these contributions 
are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the matplotlib source code, in its
entirety, is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the 
collective copyright of the entire matplotlib Development Team. If individual contributors 
want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, 
they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit 
the change to one of the matplotlib repositories.

The Matplotlib Development Team is the set of all contributors to the matplotlib project. A 
full list can be obtained from the git version control logs.
